<p id="tribute-info"> Erwin Smith was the 13th commander of the Scouting Corp. Discerning, intelligent, and widely respected, Erwin was an able commander. While he cared deeply for his men, he did not hesitate to sacrifice them for the good and prosperity of mankind, and his men proved more than willing to stake their lives at his order. 
<div></div>
    <p id="tribute-info"> Erwin was a serious man, calculating, and always planning far in the future. </p>

<div></div>
    <p id="tribute-info">Since he was a child, he had an inquiring mind that did not accept what he was told just because it was the prevailing current of thought. He wondered about the existence of humanity before the walls, and why, even though the records of what happened were lost, there were no oral accounts from an earlier time. His father and he shared the theory that the King had altered people's memories to control them. Erwin shared these thoughts with the other children in town, which led to the murder of his father, arranged as an "accident" by the First Interior Squad of the Military Police.</p> 
<div></div>
<p id="tribute-info">After graduation, Erwin joined the Scouting Corps, where he thrived as a soldier and soon had people under his command. As a squad leader, he invented the Long-Distance Enemy Scouting Formation to minimize casualties on expeditions.</p> 
<div></div>
<p id="tribute-info">He eventually became the 13th Commander of the Scouting Corps in the year 845.</p>

<div></div>
<p id="tribute-info">Erwin met his end on a mission with Eren Yaeger's group in Shiganshina. During the mission, the Beast Titan threw a rock that trapped their horses outside the wall gate of Maria. Erwin's goal was to get what was left of his men to reach Eren's basement, so he started to plan a distraction strategy to ensure some of them could survive.</p>
<div></div>
<p id="tribute-info">With the Scouting Corps facing defeat and the Beast Titan raining down a barrage of stones, Erwin decided to send himself to certain death and recruit Levi to guarantee his chance to reach the Beast Titan without being detected. In his final charge towards the Titans, he declared that it is the duty of the living to give meaning to those who have died. His recruits agreed to ride to their deaths.</p>
<div></div>
<p id="tribute-info">However, Erwin did not die immediately. He was severely injured and unconscious. The remaining scouts had only one shot left with the liquid to become a Titan. The decision to save him was left to Levi, who ultimately gave the serum to Armin, remembering Erwin's wish to give up his dreams.</p>
<div></div>
<p id="tribute-info">Erwin Smith died peacefully in the year 850.</p>
